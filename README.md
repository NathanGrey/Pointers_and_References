# Pointers_and_References
Assignment 8.1: Getting to Know Pointers
This assignment is a bit different and is made up of three parts. Answers to question two and three must be working and error-free code. This means that it will compile and run as expected if it is pasted into a .cpp file.

Part 1: Write the definitions for the following pointers/functions.

pPartOne as a pointer to a char.
pPartTwo as a pointer to any type of data.
function FunctionOne which takes a pPointer of type void and size of type int (return type of integer)
function FunctionTwo which takes a reference of type char and a pointer of type int (return type of void)
Part 2: Write function void Swap( . . . ) that takes two integers and swaps their values.

Part 3: Write a function called To1337Speak(). Convert a c-style string into 1337 speak. Look for the terminating character to find the end of the string.
